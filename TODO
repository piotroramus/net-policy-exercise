* generate big orders - in frontend or client? maybe frontend? thee only downside is that the traffic will be smaller
   if I had a separate service to generate orders then maybe the client would be already slowed down before asking our application
   I could simply add bandwidth policy on the generating service
    -> it seems to me that running few Flask servers is a heavy think... maybe consider moving generator to frontend?

* write a script to create contiv networks/policies etc - written basic skeleton, but policies need to be added
* test bandwidth policies with big orders
* write client - written, but some more auto-load should be added depending on how the testing goes


* show that it is possible to set up independent infrastructure in the same time in the same hosts using multi-tenancy
  without worrying about interfering network addresses


CONTIV DOES NOT WORK WITH KUBECTL SERVICE hostnames! At least I think it doesn't...
