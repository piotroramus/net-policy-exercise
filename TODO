* generate big orders - in frontend or client? maybe frontend? thee only downside is that the traffic will be smaller
   if I had a separate service to generate orders then maybe the client would be already slowed down before asking our application
   I could simply add bandwidth policy on the generating service

* write a script to automatically bring the contiv VMs
* write a script to create contiv networks/policies etc
* fix the labels in the ymls
* test bandwidth policies with big orders
* write client
