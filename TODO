1. push this code to github
2. generate big orders - in frontend or client? maybe frontend? thee only downside is that the traffic will be smaller
   if I had a separate service to generate orders then maybe the client would be already slowed down before asking our application
   I could simply add bandwidth policy on the generating service

3. write a script to automatically bring the contiv VMs
4. write a script to create convitv networks/policies etc
5. fix the labels in the ymls
6. test bandwidth policies with big orders
7. write client
